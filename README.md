# Software for the SunFounder Smart Video Car Kit for Raspberry Pi

## Usage
+ Use cable_management for instructions on how to connect the hardware
+ Upload the software on the car
+ Run remote.py to start the server
+ Connect using web browser from another device on the LAN

## Disclaimer:
+ The code was written a long time ago and doesn't follow almost any PEP8 rules.
+ There are known issues with some front-end functionality due on Google changes that forbid access to the accelerometer  from an unsecure web app.
+ The video tends to freeze on my Pi due to low memory so there might be better ways to handle it.
+ The cable management images are almost impossible to understand unless you are not me.
+ This is for personal usage only, so...
+ I don't care and don't hive time to fix these so deal with it.
